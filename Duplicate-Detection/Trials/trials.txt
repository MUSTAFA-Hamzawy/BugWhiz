some common methods:

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
   - Term Frequency (TF): Measures the frequency of a term in a document.
   - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures the importance of a term by considering its frequency across all documents.
   - TF-IDF: The product of TF and IDF, highlighting terms that are frequent in a document but infrequent in the entire corpus.

2. Bag of Words (BoW):
   - Represents text by the frequency of each word in the corpus.
   - Simple but effective method where each document is represented as a vector of word counts.

    Results:   
    --------
    Precision: 0.6190476190476191
    Recall: 0.8219850486321256

3. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):
   - Uses singular value decomposition (SVD) on term-document matrices to reduce dimensionality and capture latent semantic structures.

   Results:
   --------
   Precision: 0.4482758620689655
   Recall: 0.8483212785214235
